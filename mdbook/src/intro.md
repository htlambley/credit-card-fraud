# Introduction
This book gives an overview of using machine learning techniques to classify a dataset of **credit card transactions** to try and detect fraudulent transactions. 

We will be using Python and the scikit-learn package [1] in our analysis. Many of the ideas we discuss can be explored in much greater detail in the references given in each section—many of the topics discussed here will only be covered in brief, but the literature is vast and rich on machine learning, growing rapidly each day.

### Assumed Knowledge
- We'll be using Python, so a familiarity with the language is helpful.
- In order to discuss the algorithms and statistical techniques, we'll be using standard mathematical concepts and notation. We'll try to be rigorous but also explore the intuitive ideas behind the algorithms, most of which can be understood quite well graphically.

### Goals
By the end of this book, we will have constructed a classifier using modern techniques that can achieve high accuracy in detecting fraud on the data we use. On the way, we'll discuss many interesting topics in machine learning and statistical analysis.
